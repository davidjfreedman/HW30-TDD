Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### Console-based

Project: Write out your javascript code using the Test-Driven Development method in order to make the program pass the necessary tests.

Description: Working with TDD was interesting, and is certainly a useful tool to have under my belt. The overall project was fairly straightforward, so I added a few quirks to make it more interesting. For example, I had the program output some weirdness if the user doesn't specify what they are feeding the pets (console.logged at the bottom on pageload).

Why?: The goal was to gain an understanding of a different development style, specifically one that aims to simplify code and focus attention on issues from the outset.
